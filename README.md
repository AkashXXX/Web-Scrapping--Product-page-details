The code was used to scrap the product image, product title, discount, selling price of the product from the product page whose url is given along with some other details of the product. The output contains the product image and a prompt column that will be used for genrating banner ads for that particular product. The output genrated work as an input for chatgpt api to generate an image for each product.
Note: Here I used selenium to scrap the data because product image url was not present in raw html but being fetch by some api or a javascript code. Another challenge was to give a pause after each row while running the code otherwise it won't fetch and give blank output.
For better understanding, an input and output file is also attached in this repository.
